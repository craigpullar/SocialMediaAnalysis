# SocialMediaAnalysis

<p>A group project I had in second year. It was to analyse social media. I regretfully suggest we make a standalone 
java application which in turn made interacting with the api harder which in turn slowed down production. However
 we did get functionality on retrieving tweets and analysing them. The majority of the code was mine as head of development
 within the team.</p>
